## Evaluation Plan for youtube-summarize project

**I. Functionality:**

*   **Goal:** Verify that the project correctly downloads YouTube videos, extracts transcripts, and generates summaries using both Gemini API and local Ollama LLM.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Run the script with various YouTube video URLs.
    2.  Check if the videos are downloaded successfully.
    3.  Check if the transcripts are extracted correctly.
    4.  Check if the summaries are generated correctly using both Gemini and Ollama.
    5.  Test with different prompt files to ensure they are correctly loaded and used.
    6.  Test with videos that have and do not have subtitles.
    7.  Test different command-line arguments and options.
    8.  Verify that the output is saved to the correct directory.
    9.  Verify the error handling for invalid URLs or missing dependencies.
*   **Tools:** `execute_command`, manual inspection of downloaded videos, transcripts, and summaries.

**II. Performance:**

*   **Goal:** Measure the time it takes to download and summarize videos using both Gemini API and local Ollama LLM.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Run the script with various YouTube video URLs and measure the execution time.
    2.  Compare the performance of Gemini API and local Ollama LLM.
    3.  Identify any bottlenecks in the process.
    4.  Consider the impact of video length and complexity on performance.
*   **Tools:** `execute_command` with `time` command, manual timing, profiling tools (if necessary).

**III. Code Quality:**

*   **Goal:** Assess the code for readability, maintainability, and adherence to coding standards.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Review the code for comments, documentation, and clear variable names.
    2.  Check for code duplication and unnecessary complexity.
    3.  Evaluate the use of design patterns and best practices.
    4.  Run a linter to identify any style issues or potential errors.
*   **Tools:** `read_file`, manual code review, linters (e.g., `flake8`, `pylint`).

**IV. Architecture:**

*   **Goal:** Evaluate the project's structure, modularity, and separation of concerns.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Analyze the project's directory structure and file organization.
    2.  Examine the dependencies between modules and classes.
    3.  Assess the use of interfaces and abstraction.
    4.  Refer to the architecture diagram in `architecture.md` and verify its accuracy.
*   **Tools:** `list_files`, `read_file`, manual code review.

**V. Extensibility:**

*   **Goal:** Determine how easy it is to add new features or support different LLMs.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Identify the key extension points in the code.
    2.  Evaluate the use of interfaces and abstract classes.
    3.  Consider the impact of adding new dependencies.
    4.  Assess the modularity of the code and how easily new modules can be integrated.
*   **Tools:** `read_file`, manual code review.

**VI. User Experience:**

*   **Goal:** Assess the ease of use and intuitiveness of the command-line interface.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Run the script with different command-line arguments and options.
    2.  Evaluate the clarity of the help messages and error messages.
    3.  Consider the ease of installation and setup.
    4.  Check if the output is well-formatted and easy to understand.
*   **Tools:** `execute_command` with `--help` option, manual testing of the command-line interface.

**VII. Security:**

*   **Goal:** Identify any potential security vulnerabilities in the project.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Check for any hardcoded credentials or API keys.
    2.  Evaluate the handling of user input and prevent injection attacks.
    3.  Consider the security implications of using external libraries and APIs.
    4.  Assess the project's vulnerability to denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Tools:** `read_file`, manual code review, security scanning tools (if necessary).

**VIII. Plan Summary**
I will proceed by using the tools to perform the steps outlined above to complete the evaluation.
