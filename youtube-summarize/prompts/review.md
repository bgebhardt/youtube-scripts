## Tag Generation Guidelines

After completing your summary, generate 3-10 relevant tags that capture the video's content, purpose, and target audience. Tags should be useful for categorization, search, and content discovery.

### Tag Categories to Consider:
- **Content Type**: #review, #tutorial, #news, #comparison, #guide, #tips, #analysis
- **Industry/Domain**: #gaming, #tech, #business, #education, #cooking, #fitness, #diy
- **Specific Topics**: #rpg, #coding, #investing, #productivity, #travel, #photography
- **Audience Level**: #beginner, #advanced, #intermediate, #expert
- **Format/Style**: #quicktips, #deepdive, #stepbystep, #breakdown, #explained
- **Trending/Timely**: #2025, #trending, #breaking, #update, #latest

### Tag Rules:
- Use lowercase with # prefix
- Keep tags 1-2 words maximum
- Prioritize searchable terms people actually use
- Include both broad and specific tags
- Avoid overly generic tags like #video or #content
- Include brand/product names when relevant (e.g., #nintendo, #iphone, #chatgpt)

### Tag Selection Priority:
1. **Primary topic** (most important subject)
2. **Content type** (review, tutorial, etc.)
3. **Target audience** (who should watch)
4. **Specific products/brands** mentioned
5. **Trending keywords** relevant to the content

### Examples by Video Type:

**Gaming Review**: #gaming #review #ps5 #xbox #rpg #2025
**Coding Tutorial**: #coding #tutorial #python #beginner #programming #webdev
**Business News**: #business #news #stocks #finance #investing #market
**Cooking Guide**: #cooking #recipe #italian #pasta #quickmeals #homecooking
**Product Comparison**: #review #comparison #tech #smartphone #android #iphone

## Timestamp Extraction Guidelines

When creating summaries, extract and include timestamps for key points to enable direct navigation to relevant video sections. This transforms summaries from passive text into interactive viewing guides.

### How to Handle Timestamps

**Transcript Format Recognition:**
- Look for timestamps in formats like: `[00:15]`, `0:15`, `(2:30)`, `2m30s`, or `at 5 minutes`
- Convert all timestamps to `MM:SS` or `H:MM:SS` format for consistency
- When exact timestamps aren't available, use approximate times based on transcript position

**Timestamp Placement Rules:**
- Include timestamps for all major points and key moments
- Prioritize actionable content, important announcements, and key explanations
- Add timestamps to specific examples, demonstrations, or code snippets
- Include timestamps for section transitions and topic changes

## Output Format

```

## Content Priorities
1. **Pricing accuracy** - Double-check all prices and deals
2. **Feature verification** - Ensure technical specs are correct
3. **Use case clarity** - Who should and shouldn't buy this
4. **Comparison fairness** - Present competitor info objectively
5. **Deal urgency** - Highlight time-sensitive offers

## Quality Check
Your summary should:
- [ ] Help someone decide whether to buy without watching the video
- [ ] Present balanced view (not just marketing hype)
- [ ] Include specific details that matter for purchase decisions
- [ ] Clearly state who this product is and isn't good for
- [ ] Mention any significant caveats or limitations

### Quality Check for Tags:
- [ ] Would someone search for these terms to find this content?
- [ ] Do the tags accurately represent the video's main topics?
- [ ] Are there 3-10 tags total?
- [ ] Mix of broad (#gaming) and specific (#dnd5e) tags included?
- [ ] No redundant or overly similar tags?


### Timestamp Quality Guidelines

**Accuracy Priority:**
- Use exact timestamps when available in transcript
- For approximate times, round to nearest 5-15 seconds
- Err on the side of starting slightly before the content begins

**Coverage Goals:**
- Include timestamps for 60-80% of key points
- Prioritize the most valuable or complex explanations
- Don't timestamp every minor detail - focus on jump-worthy content

**Format Consistency:**
- Always use `**[MM:SS]**` format at the start of bullet points
- For videos over 1 hour, use `**[H:MM:SS]**` format
- Keep timestamp format consistent throughout the summary

### Special Timestamp Sections

#### For Long-Form Content:
```
## Chapter Breakdown
- **[0:00]** Introduction and overview
- **[3:15]** Main topic begins  
- **[12:30]** Key demonstration or example
- **[18:45]** Advanced concepts
- **[25:10]** Conclusion and next steps
```

#### For Multi-Topic Videos:
```
## Topic Timestamps
- **[2:10]** Topic 1: [Brief description]
- **[8:30]** Topic 2: [Brief description]  
- **[15:45]** Topic 3: [Brief description]
```

### Implementation Notes

**When Timestamps Aren't Available:**
- Note in summary: "Timestamps not available in transcript"
- Still provide detailed summary but mention limitation
- Consider adding section headers instead of timestamps

**Timestamp Validation:**
- Ensure timestamps make logical sense (increasing order)
- Verify major timestamps align with key content
- Remove any obviously incorrect timestamps

**User Experience:**
- Timestamps should make the video more navigable, not cluttered
- Focus on moments where viewers would want to jump directly
- Balance detail with usability
